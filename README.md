# Social_Abstractions

**Important Note:** This project is designed to leverage advanced models for efficient data processing and analytics. Although GPT models are recommended for higher quality results, the flow is adaptable to other APIs, like **[Alternative API Name]**, by replacing the core model component. This can provide improved contextual understanding and nuanced responses.

---

## Overview

**Social_Abstractions** is a sophisticated tool designed to provide intelligent abstractions and insights from social data, using cutting-edge technologies like **[LangFlow, custom APIs, databases]**. The system simplifies the process of extracting meaningful insights from large datasets through a streamlined, user-friendly interface.

The core workflow, `Social_Abstractions_Flow`, processes user input and returns actionable insights using a variety of AI-driven components. 

---

## Key Components

1. **File Upload:** Allows users to upload datasets, such as CSV or JSON files, for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Splits and processes the input file into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
3. **User Query Interface:** Accepts natural language queries from users for easy interaction.
4. **Database Storage:** 
   - Utilizes **[Database Name, e.g., MongoDB, Astra DB]** for storing data.
   - Uses advanced features like **[NVIDIA vectorization, Hugging Face]** for searching and retrieving relevant results from the dataset.
5. **Query Processing:** A custom-built prompt generator processes search results and user input to provide relevant, easy-to-understand answers.
6. **AI Model Component:** 
   - Uses **[Groq/OpenAI Model]** (GPT, GPT-4, etc.) for generating responses to user queries based on the processed data.

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload Data:** Users upload their dataset (e.g., `data.csv` or `data.json`).
2. **Data Splitting & Processing:** The data is split into smaller, processable chunks.
3. **Input User Query:** Users can ask questions about the data through an interactive query interface.
4. **Database Search:** The system processes the query and data chunks using **[vectorization, e.g., NVIDIA, custom search algorithms]** and retrieves the relevant results.
5. **Results Parsing:** The search results are parsed for better readability and usability.
6. **Query Response:** The system generates a concise, helpful response to the user's query.

## Benefits of Using OpenAI Models

When replacing **[Groq Component]** with OpenAI models, you will experience:

- **Better Contextual Understanding:** OpenAI models like GPT-4 are adept at understanding and responding to complex, nuanced queries.
- **Improved Language Quality:** OpenAI models often produce more refined, grammatically correct, and user-friendly responses.
- **Enhanced Query Handling:** OpenAI models handle ambiguous or unclear queries more effectively than other APIs.

---

## Prerequisites

- **LangFlow Web Application:** Used for creating and managing workflows.
- **[Database Service Name]:** Make sure you have an account with **[Database Service Name]** (e.g., Astra DB, MongoDB) to store and retrieve data.
- **[Optional API Integration]:** If you're replacing Groq with OpenAI, ensure your OpenAI API key is configured in the project.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harsh16Bhardwaj/Social_Abstractions.git
    cd Social_Abstractions
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your **API key** for **[Groq/OpenAI]** (if applicable) in the environment variables.

4. Upload your dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) and input your query through the interface.

---

## Usage

1. Upload your dataset to the system.
2. Ask a question using the query interface.
3. View the insightful responses generated from your data.

---

## Integrating with the Website

A React-based front-end has been created to connect directly to this flow for easier usage. The website allows:

- User-friendly interface for uploading datasets.
- Simple query interface for real-time data insights.
- API calls to the core workflow, displaying responses instantly.


---

## Langflow Setup

To use this flow with **Langflow**, follow these steps:

1. Upload the JSON configuration for **`Social_Abstractions_Flow`** in Langflow.
2. Ensure your API key for **[Groq/OpenAI]** is integrated for smooth execution.
3. Input your dataset and start querying!
